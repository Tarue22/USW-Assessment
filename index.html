      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I am 20 years old as of today and l am from Zimbabwe. I come from a small family of 4, me being the first out of two children. Growing up l always wanted to be a pilot but that was until l got my first ever computer. l discovered a whole new world, it was like a child who had discovered ice cream for the first time. Over time my interest and passion for computers grew and later on was when l decided to take up Computer Science. I would not say l am good but l am a work in progress, mostly l enjoy coding, designing as well as developing and I enjoy turning messy ideas into tidy interfaces.
      In my spare time l like to relax and watch some movies and documentaries, l also appreciate a good read fiction preferably. I enjoy taking nature hikes and travelling as well, l think that the more we explore the world as computer scientist we get to see and experience some challenges that can be tackled via computing. I like sports, back in highschool l used to be part of the rugby, swimming and tennis teams, l am not so invested in them anymore as l have now started University.
      I started at the University of South Wales in 2024 doing my foundation year where we were introduced to university life and were taught how to navigate it. I passed my foundation and progressed to first year and so far so good. During my 4 year tenure at the university l hope to learn as much as l can and implicate that knowledge into the real world and make a difference through computing.
      
      Skillset
      Since starting University l have learnt how to code in various languages which include Python for its versatility, Java, JavaScript and also C++. Through assignments and extensive research l have also become familiar with Crptography.</p>
