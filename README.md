# Starter Portfolio (HTML + CSS)

What this is
- A small, easy-to-edit portfolio page using plain HTML and CSS.
- Style: semi-professional and nonchalant.
- Colors: gray-focused palette with blue accents, white backgrounds, and black text.

Files included
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling, color palette, layout

How to use (simple steps)
1. Replace "Your Name" and the placeholder text (email, GitHub link, project descriptions) with your info.
2. Add project links to the "View repo" anchors or replace them with real URLs.
3. Upload both files to a GitHub repository (or a branch).
4. Optional: Enable GitHub Pages in repository Settings -> Pages -> Source -> choose main branch / root. Your site will be live at https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo.

Why it looks this way (kid-style explanation)
- Think of the page like a clean desk: most of the desk is calm gray so your cool blue pencil stands out.
- Big name at the top = your name on a nametag.
- Projects are like small cards on the desk — quick notes of what you've made.
- The page isn't shouting. It just whispers: "I know what I do, and I'm chill about it."

Tips
- Keep project descriptions 1–2 sentences.
- Use your real GitHub links so people can click and see your code.
- Change colors in :root in styles.css if you want a different blue or a darker gray.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a contact form (needs a backend or a service).
- Convert this to a single-file template (HTML with embedded CSS).
- Add icons or a download-ready resume link.
